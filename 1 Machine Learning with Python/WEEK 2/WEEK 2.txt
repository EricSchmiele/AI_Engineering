WEEK 2

Video 1
	*What is regression
		*X: independent variables (explain the data)
		*Y: dependent variable (classify the data, the variable to be estimated via regression)
	*Types of regression
		*simple regression (when an independent variable is used to predict a dependent variable)
			*simple linear regression
			*simple non-linear regression
		*multiple regression (more than one independent variables are used to predict a dependent variable)
			*multiple linear regression
			*multiple non-linear regression

	*Training accuracy
		*accuracy of the model when using the values from the training set
		*high training accuracy can mean over-fit. Over-fit is when the model is overly trained to the specific training set and may become non-generalized
	*Out-of-sample accuracy
		*accuracy of predictions of the model using data from outside of the training set

Video 4
	*MAE mean absolute value (just the average error)
	*MSE mean squared error (more popular than MAE because the focus is given towards large errors)
	*RMSE root mean squared error (more popular because it is easy to interpret given the unit of measure)
	*RAE relative absolute error (normalization of normal errors)
	*RSE relative squared error (similar to RAE but more used by the data science community because it is used to determine R²)
	*R² (not an error per se, it is a popular accuracy metric for models; the higher the R², the better the model fits your data)
