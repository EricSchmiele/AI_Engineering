	*Major machine learning techniques
		*Regression/Estimation
			*Predicting continuous values (predicting the price of a house)
		*Classification
			*Predicting the item class/category of a case (predicting if a cancer is binign of malificent)
		*Clustering
			*finding the structure of a data; summarization (customer segmentation at the banking field)
		*Associations
			*association frequent co-occuring items/events (items usually purchased together)
		*Anomaly detection
			*discovering abnormal and unusual cases (fraud detection)
		*Sequence mining
			*predicting next events; (click-stream in websites (Markov Model, HMM))
		*Dimension Reduction
			*reducing the size of data (PCA)
		*Recommendation systems
			*recommending items
	*Differnce between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning
		*AI: wants to make a computer intelligent and capable of decision making in order to mimic the cognitive function of humans
			*computer vision
			*language processing
			*creativity
			*summarization
			*etc
		*Machine learning: branch of AI that covers statistical intelligence; teaches the computer to learn from some problems and then solve other similar ones
			*classification
			*clustering
			*neural network
			*etc
		*Revolution in ML
			*Deep learning: specific field from ML where computers can learn to make descisions on their own (deeper level of automation in comparison to other fields of ML)

	*Python libraries for ML
		*NumPy (manage N-dimensional arrays in python)
		*SciPy (numerical algoriths - signal processing, optimization, statistics, etc)
		*matplotlib (á¹•loting package)
		*if you're not familiar with these packages, take the DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON course first
		*pandas (high-performance easy-to-use data structures)
		*scikit-learn (collection of algorithms and tools for ML)
	*More about scikit-learn
		*free software ML learning library
		*classification, regression and clustering algorithms
		*works with NumPy and SciPy
		*great documentation
		*easy to implement

Video 4
	*teaching the model with labeled data
		*atributes are the characteristics used to classify a model
		*features are the values of spicific atributes for a specific data sample
		*observation is a specific sample
	*classification is determining a descrete class label or category
	*regression is predicting a continuous value
	*Unsupervised techniques
		*dimension reduction (removes reduntant information)
		*density estimation (very simple technique used to find some structure within the data)
		*market basket analysis (modeling technique based on the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you're more likely to buy another group of items)
		*clustering (grouping data points that are somehow similar)
			*discovering structure
			*summarization
			*anomaly detection
